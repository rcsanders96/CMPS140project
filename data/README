This folder contains the output data of our testing.

The "train.csv" files in this directory are the training data for the 20 stocks
The "test.csv" files in this directory are the actual data for the 20 stocks we tested

The subdirectories contain five types of files:
-"-output.csv" files are the ouputs of the models with various hyperparameters
-"-error.csv" files add additional evaluation information
-"eval.txt" contains information about average errors using these hyperparameters
-"daily-evaluation.txt" contains information about how the accuracy of the model changes based on the day
-"-graph.png" files graph the predicted opening prices with the real opening prices of each stocks

The subdirectories are as follows:
-"control" uses the adam optimizer, mean-squared loss, and drops out 20% of nodes.
	All other subdirectories only change one of these hyperparameters each
-"dropout1" only drops out 10% of nodes
-"mean_absolute" uses the mean-absolute loss function
-"sgd" uses the SGD optimizer
